    <p>Hainanese chicken rice is a classic dish made by poaching a whole chicken until tender, then serving it with fragrant, garlicky rice cooked in chicken broth. It's accompanied by flavorful dipping sauces like ginger-garlic and chili, with fresh cucumber slices for garnish. The dish is known for its simple yet aromatic flavors, making it a comforting and satisfying meal.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 whole chicken (about 1.5-2 kg)</li>
      <li>Salt (for rubbing the chicken)</li>
      <li>5-6 slices of ginger</li>
      <li>3-4 stalks of spring onions</li>
      <li>Water (enough to submerge the chicken)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Clean the chicken: Rub the chicken skin with salt to exfoliate and remove any impurities. Rinse it thoroughly.</li>
      <li>Boil the chicken: Bring a large pot of water to a boil with ginger slices and spring onions. Submerge the chicken, ensuring it’s fully covered by water. Lower the heat and let it simmer for about 35–45 minutes (depending on the size of the chicken), until cooked through.</li>
      <li>Ice bath: Once the chicken is cooked, immediately transfer it to an ice bath (cold water with ice cubes) for about 10 minutes. This gives the skin a firm, smooth texture.</li>
      <li>Rest and cut: After cooling, rub a little sesame oil over the chicken skin. Cut the chicken into serving pieces.</li>
    </ol>
